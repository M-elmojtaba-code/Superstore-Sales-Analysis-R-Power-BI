## 🤖 Use of AI Assistance
As a junior data analyst, I used AI-based tools as a learning and support resource during this project.  
AI assistance was primarily used to help understand concepts, validate approaches, and improve code structure.  
All data cleaning, analysis decisions, and dashboard design were reviewed, implemented, and interpreted by me to ensure full understanding of the workflow and results.

## 🔍 Key Business Insights
The following insights were derived from interactive filtering and visual exploration of the Power BI dashboard.

### 1️⃣ Category Contribution to Sales
The **Technology** category accounts for the **highest percentage of total sales**, making it the primary revenue-driving category.  
This suggests strong demand for technology products compared to other categories.

### 2️⃣ Sales Trends and Seasonality
Sales data shows a **significant increase toward the end of the first quarter**, which is likely caused by a **large deal or bulk purchase** from a major customer or organization.

Additionally, sales increase again toward the **end of the year**, indicating seasonal demand that may be linked to promotions, budget cycles, or year-end purchasing behavior.

### 3️⃣ Profit and Loss by Sub-Category
The profit and loss analysis reveals that **not all high-selling sub-categories are profitable**.  
Some sub-categories consistently generate losses, highlighting potential issues related to pricing, discounts, or shipping costs.

This insight helps identify areas that require further cost or pricing review.

### 4️⃣ Regional Sales Distribution
The map visualization shows a high concentration of sales in the **Eastern and Northern regions**.  
This is likely due to the presence of **large cities**, which attract higher population density and purchasing activity.  
In addition, easier and faster delivery to nearby urban areas contributes to higher order volumes.
